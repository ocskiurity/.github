## Lore
In the mystical realm where technology and the digital universe blur, n0tte and Initiator stand as guardians of data privacy. Named after the Italian word for night, n0tte is a beacon that transforms darkness into endless possibilities. In an enchanted forest, raw data roams free, represented by a lone wolf whose true potential is hidden. Under a full moon, this wolf transforms into a powerful werewolf, symbolizing Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), allowing secure, private data processing. Overseeing this process is a green-eyed demon, safeguarding the data with advanced security protocols. n0tte, the illuminating CLI, enables blockchain inference on FHE-encrypted data, guiding it through secure computations. Initiator, a collection of Python scripts, prepares data and model weights for this journey, akin to a secret cult initiation. Together, n0tte and Initiator create a harmonious interplay of privacy and power, enabling a new era of secure computation. They are the torchbearers of the digital age, revealing the true potential of data while maintaining its secrecy. Embrace the legend and let n0tte and Initiator guide you through the shadows, uncovering the true potential of your data.
